# News-Subjectivity-Analysis

### Description
Claire McLean's data science project: An lingustic subjectivity assessment of articles from major news sources<br />

Goal: to assess 1) whether there is a statistically significant difference between the proportion of subjective intensifier constructions to non- subjective intensifier constructions between the 'standard' news articles (non-opinion) and a non-news text, and 2) whether there is a difference in the prevalence of subjective intensifiers between the stardard news articles and the opinion articles from the same sources<br />

Data source: 50 articles from the 'Politics' section of [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics) (25 standard, 25 opinion), and 50 articles from the 'Politics' section of [Vox](https://www.vox.com/politics) (25 standard, 25 opinion).
